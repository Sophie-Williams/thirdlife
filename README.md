# ThIRc| Life

ThIRc| Life (until I think of a better name) is an IRC bot with features to help extend your online persona and add a bit of fun to IRC.

# Existing Features

  - Join a channel and register with the bot.
  - Basically nothing else yet.

# Coming Soon Maybe

  - Navigate a virtual text-based world.
  - Switch between any number of characters using a single IRC nick.
  - Interact with users between channels.
  - Trade and use items.
  - Do other silly shit.

# Current Command Listing

Commands can be run by specifying them after `!tl` in an IRC channel where a ThIRc| Life bot is present, e.g. `!tl info`.

  - **register** - Register with the bot. Your account is tied your nick, and is only as secure as your IRC account.
  - **info [nick]** - See registration information for yourself, or another nick if specified.
